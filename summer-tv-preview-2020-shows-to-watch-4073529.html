It’s actually revving up. The 2020 summer TV slate features new and returning shows that will have you binge-watching and your DVRs jam-packed. Most of us have been watching more TV than ever while quarantining at home these past few months, and this <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>summer TV schedule</a> is going to make you want to stay put on your couch.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>A number of shows are bidding farewell this summer, including 13 Reasons Why and Fuller House.

On top of TV series, Disney will be treating us to Disney+ and Disney Channel original movies this summer. <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> has rounded up the key shows and TV movies premiering this summer as part of our 2020 summer TV preview.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4><strong>13 Reasons Why (Netflix) — June 5<br></strong>The game-changing Netflix series is coming to an end.

Chicago Fire alum <strong>Monica Raymund</strong> wows as Jackie Quiñones, Hightown’s flawed anti-hero struggling to stay sober. One of Hightown’s biggest strengths is its ensemble cast —<strong>&nbsp;James Badge Dale</strong>, <strong>Riley Voelkel</strong>, <strong>Shane Harper</strong>, and <strong>Amaury Nolasco</strong>.
