The series ran just for three seasons between 1966 and 1969. However, it became one of the most popular brands in the history of the American entertainment industry.</strong></p><p>The Star Trek cast is a male human scientist, a research biologist, who mainly worked and lived on the planet Deneva. He joined Starfleet in the 2250s, following in his father’s and younger brother’s footsteps, and was posted to the USS Enterprise under the command of Captain Christopher Pike.</p><p>The scientist was placed on the landing crew to learn how to stop the comet C/2260-Quentin from striking the planet Persephone III. Though injured, he was transported back to the Enterprise with the landing party, where he was medically treated.</p><p>The research biologist, like his father, served as a Starfleet officer and later got promoted to lieutenant in 2259. Sam got attacked and infiltrated by parasites along with the whole colony. However, by the time his brother came, he was dead.</p><p>Yes, Sam Kirk is related to James T Kirk, and both are the sons of George Samuel Kirk senior, a former human Starfleet officer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.trendingpal.com/uploads/2022/7/d1e0f281-d860-4c39-aed4-0c1d77ca77c7.webp><p>Sam was born on August 12, 2230, and lived in the 23rd century. Besides, he is the elder brother of James (born March 22, 2233), a famed starship USS Enterprise captain. The two brothers are ten years apart in age. His work at the Starfleet made him both popular and sometimes infamous.</p><p>The highly decorated starship captain served as the commanding officer of the Constitution-class starships USS Enterprise and USS Enterprise-A. He served as an explorer, soldier, time traveler, and diplomat.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113></span>The two brothers were very close, and only his younger brother was allowed to call him “Sam.” In 2265, the older brother saw off his younger brother when the latter began five-year command of the Enterprise.</p><p>After his brother departed for the mission, the elder brother started working as a civilian research biologist and lived on the planet Deneva with his family. The research scientist, however, contracted the infection a few years after his brother left and passed away before his brother’s arrival.</p><h2 id=nbspsam-kirk-family>Meet Sam Kirk Family</h2><p>Sam Kirk’s family includes his mother, his father, his brother, his wife, his kids as well as his brother’s family.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.trendingpal.com/uploads/2022/7/27991df1-2bf6-4567-9806-0c0feab7dd42.webp><p>The human scientist was born to George Samuel Kirk senior and his wife, Winona Kirk. He is a grandson of the late Tiberius Kirk. His father was a former human Starfleet officer, and his mother was of Sioux descent. Her father, James Davis, was also a member of the Starfleet.</p><p>Further, in his family, Sam has a wife and three children. The scientist married Aurelian Kirk and his sons, Peter Kirk, Alexander Kirk, and Julius Kirk. The scientist’s wife was the one to inform the captain that the parasite outbreak had occurred.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-115></span>While his brother married Miramanee, the couple is blessed by a son named David Marcus. After the parasite outbreak, the younger brother could only rescue his nephew Peter and his sister-in-law (wife of Sam).</p><h2 id=nbspsam-kirk-and-james-t-kirk-net-worth-difference>&nbsp;Sam Kirk And James T Kirk Net Worth Difference</h2><p>The net worth difference between Dan Jeannotte (star trek cast: Sam Kirk) and Paul Wesley (star trek cast: James T Kirk) is around 4-6 million dollars.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.trendingpal.com/uploads/2022/7/dd21ae54-d674-4860-be1c-d0b357f24b00.webp><p>Several sources estimate Dan’s net worth to be over $10 million, while Paul’s net worth is only thought to be around $6 million.
