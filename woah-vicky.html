Vicky quit her job after a few days as she didn’t want to be bossed around by others. However, she eventually completed her high school diploma through the online Penn Foster High School program.</p><h2><span id=Career_and_Professional_Life>Career and Professional Life</span></h2><p>Woah started her career on social media sites soon after she graduated from high school.

She claimed that she belonged to Zone 6, a famous neighborhood in Atlanta, which is known for producing famous black rappers like Gucci Mane, Young Scooter, Future, OJ da Juiceman, Rich Homie Quan, and Childish Gambino.</p><p>To prove that she referred to the black community, Victoria produced weird evidence.

She even indulged herself in things that are usually associated with African-American people. Victoria started twerking, rapping, and even adopting their accent.</p><p>She was criticized for her acts and many called her a racist. Vicky even used the ‘N-word’ in a few of her social media updates, for which she was bombarded with many hate comments. She later justified it by saying that she has every right to use the word as she belongs to the black community! Vicky has often referred to herself as ‘Melanin Queen.’ She even faked pregnancy when she was in a relationship with Papi JJ.</p><p>In 2017, Vicky released a racist diss track, ‘Ching Chong’ which was later flagged and removed from YouTube. At the time, Vicky also claimed that she was expecting a baby from an ex-boyfriend, Papi JJ.

It was reported that she has used her Instagram status to trade prizes4fun.XYZ is a spam site that promises a free iPhone X but is just a click farm that paid her for the clickthrough business she was able to generate.</p><h4 class="sc-jzJRlG cgRGjh"><span>Danielle Bregoli Feud</span></h4><p>As of 2017, Vicky has beefed with Danielle Bregoli on FaceTime. She directed multiple insults at her such as criticizing the number of males she has had sex with and her drug use. Vicky also claims that Bregoli got breast implants.</p><p>She said it all started when Instagram personality, Malu got into a feud with her before Danielle. Vicky insists that she and Malu fought because Malu was trying to “get with her baby daddy.” Because Danielle Bregoli and Malu were friends at the time, Vicky claims that the two girls were frightened to beat her up if she were to come to Los Angeles. Subsequently, she claims Bregoli got angry because Vicky was trying to do the same thing with the guy Malu was going out with.</p><p>On April 15, 2018, a video of Danielle Bregoli and Waldrip getting into an altercation at The Americana at The Brand in Glendale, California went viral on social media; Lil Tay (Waldrip’s friend) was there as well. She has allegedly talked about how she wants to fight BhadBabie. In the middle of a scuffle, Bregoli eschewed the crowd and punched Waldrip in the back of the head.</p><h2><span id=Personal_Life>Personal Life</span></h2><p>Woah Vicky was in a <strong>relationship</strong> with Papi JJ, a singer.
