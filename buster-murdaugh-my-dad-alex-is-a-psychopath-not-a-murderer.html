I mean, it has harmed my reputation. I mean, people perceive me as a murderer.”</p><p>Alex Murdaugh’s older brother said earlier this year that he thinks Alex <a href=#>is still lying about the brutal slayings of his wife and son</a>.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Buster (center) is defending his father despite his conviction for murdering his mom, but the wider Murdaugh family is not united.
