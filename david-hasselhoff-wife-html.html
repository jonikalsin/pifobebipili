So, it's not surprising that he made plans to settle down with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">co-star</a> Catherine Hickland. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Their romance was the talk of the town in the '80s, so much so that their marriage was remade as part of the show.&nbsp;The union, however, did not last too long.</p><p></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><strong>David Hasselhoff posing for a picture.</strong> (Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In 1989, the couple could no longer call each other husband and wife. Hickland later&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">remarried</a> in 1992.</p><h2>Troubles With Second Wife</h2><p>The heartthrob did not give up on finding someone else to call his wife. And soon enough, he married Pamela Bach.</p><p>Bach was an actress in Knight Rider, and they&nbsp;met each other back in 1986.&nbsp;While Hasselhoff's divorce with Hickland cannot be objectively attributed to an affair with Bach, the new couple had a long marriage. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>But, the higher one goes, the harder they fall, and the Hasselhoff-Bach divorce is perhaps one of the messiest ones and damaging to either of their careers.&nbsp;</p><p>After 16 years, in 2006, the pair filed for <a href=# rel="follow noopener">divorce</a> over "irreconcilable differences." Hasselhoff had to pay his former wife $21,000 per month after separation.&nbsp;</p><p>Amid their separation, the pair had to fight over the custody of their two children, Taylor and Hayley. However, the&nbsp;actor was awarded full custody of two children.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>His former wife only received visiting privileges after months of legal wrangling.</p><p></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p><strong>David Hasselhoff with his two children, Taylor and Hayley.</strong> (Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Then, his access to the girls had been temporarily revoked before the ruling because a video of him in an inebriated state had been shown to the judge.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>In the end, the judge ruled the actor should be the only one with legal and physical custody of the daughters, who were 17 and 14 years old, when the case was filed.</p><p>Ten years later, in 2016, he told the court that he was broke.&nbsp;The actor said he was in the Baywatch movie to stay "current," but he had little luck.</p><p>He also revealed that he earns $112k per month but spends $66k, excluding taxes and housing expenses. After that, he seldom saves anything.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Bach claimed no one wants to hire a mid-50s actress for any <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">role</a>. Despite her efforts, she could not land any gigs.</p><p>In 2017, the spousal support was decreased to $10,000 per month.&nbsp;Bach further claimed he never paid her $1 million to balance their assets after they split, despite his owning jet skis, boats, trusts, and home.</p><p>When they separated, she only got $325,000.&nbsp;To the courts, the Knight Rider actor said he was nearing retirement and couldn't afford the $10,000 monthly reimbursements. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><p><strong>David Hasselhoff with his third wife, Hayley Roberts, on their wedding day. </strong>(Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><p>He said he was paying spousal support from his retirement fund. However, by November that year, it was agreed that he would only pay her $5000. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-176 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Current Marriage Despite Age Difference</h2><p>As a judge on Britain's Got Talent&nbsp;in 2011, Hasselhoff initially met his eventual third spouse, <a href=# rel=follow>Hayley Roberts</a>, in the foyer of a hotel in Cardiff.&nbsp;</p><p>She reportedly begged for an autograph, to which he consented if she gave him her cell phone number first. Before their encounter, Roberts was making ends meet as <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">a makeup artist</a> at a department store.</p><p>It didn't take long for the two to become more than just friends, and in 2016, Hasselhoff and Roberts announced their engagement. Two years later, they got <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">married</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The Italian wedding ceremony was held&nbsp;before a small group of close friends and family members, including the actor's two children.&nbsp;</p><p>It is safe to say that Hasselhoff and Roberts are still happy as ever, despite their nearly thirty-year age difference.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJyRq7aleceaqqydnJ28p7KMsKCfnV6dwa64</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jana-kramers-dating-history-her-boyfriends-and-ex-husbands.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jana Kramer's dating history: Her boyfriends and ex-husbands">&larr;
