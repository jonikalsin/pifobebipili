The pair first crossed paths at one of Lewis's concerts in Los Angeles. At the time, Brown was 25 and romantically involved with her ex-husband and the singer's cousin, Rusty.</p><p class=dh>But despite their romance, Lewis still looked at her then-boyfriend, who was also present at the concert, and told him he would marry Brown if Rusty did not. However, after the show, the singer and Rusty's girlfriend did not cross paths again for a long time.</p><p class=dh>Within that period, Lewis tied the knot multiple times. His sixth marriage was to Kerrie McCarver in 1985, which crumbled in 2005, after two decades. Following another failed marriage, Lewis remained single for a while before crossing paths again with Brown in 2010.</p><p class=dh>That year, the pianist suffered serious health issues and was forced to hire Brown as his caregiver. As time progressed, the pair grew closer and closer, becoming more attached to each other. Then, six months after their second meeting, Lewis and Brown started dating.</p><p class=dh>The news of the lovebirds' relationship shocked everyone, as many only thought of Brown as Lewis's caregiver. However, the pair had grown very fond of each other behind the scenes.</p><p class=dh>On December 25, 2010, the singer decided to take his romance with Brown to the next level by giving her a surprise present under the Christmas tree. <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.the-sun.com/entertainment/6539871/who-jerry-lee-lewis-wife-judith-brown/>According to</a> Lewis's caregiver:</p><p class=dh>"He gave me a ring for Christmas but didn't tell me it was an engagement ring until a few months later. He just said, 'I want to let you know that the ring I gave you for Christmas was a promise that I would marry you.'"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/b93534a0f94abc9f1608c74587e81a15.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Jerry Lee Lewis, Ringo Starr and Judith Brown attend the 30th Annual Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame Induction Ceremony at Public Hall on April 18, 2015, in Cleveland, Ohio. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>Following the engagement, Lewis suggested that he and his girlfriend tie the knot in Ferriday, Mississippi, in March 2012, to which she agreed. On that day, the couple exchanged wedding vows in a small ceremony surrounded by close family and friends.</p><p class=dh>Brown noted that everything felt like it was meant to be as soon as they sat down in front of the preacher. According to her, neither she nor Lewis felt like they had been previously married, as it seemed like their first time exchanging wedding vows.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/8aae43e686c5c198f1deb2c2a3545cb7.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Rock and Roll Hall of Fame musician Jerry Lee Lewis performs onstage at Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts on November 17, 2018, in Cerritos, California. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>Brown confessed that when they first met and Lewis told Rusty he would marry her, she didn't take his words seriously. However, decades later, it was almost unbelievable that they eventually ended up together.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Jerry Lewis's Marriage to Brown Created Rift between Him and His Family</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Undoubtedly, Lewis and Brown were thrilled to spend forever with each other. However, the pair's union caused a rift between the singer and his family, especially his ex-wife, Myra Gale. Gale was not only Lewis's ex-wife but also his cousin.</p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>In 2015, Lewis chatted with the Guardian, opening up about his fears regarding life after death.

After welcoming two children, the pair's union crumbled in 1970, when news that Lewis married his 13-year-old cousin made the headlines and proved detrimental to his career.</p><p class=dh>Following their divorce, everything seemed to be going on well until Lewis decided to marry Brown. It is important to note that Rusty, Brown's ex-husband, was also Myra's brother. So, the complications that surrounded their relationship made matters worse between Lewis and Myra.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/e64455ab43a53bc9263c31dcd6d49259.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Jerry Lee Lewis hugs Myra Brown as they arrive in the airport from London after his tour of England was canceled, New York, May 28, 1958. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>In a 2015 Instagram post, the latter confessed that after she and the singer parted ways, they still stayed in touch because of their daughter, Phoebe.</p><p class=dh>According to Myra, Phoebe <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/5aj-d6l9Ju/>worked</a> for the entertainment icon, and whenever she visited her daughter, she would also see Lewis. However, everything changed when the singer married Brown, who had not yet ended things with Rusty when she and Lewis began dating.</p><p class=dh>Myra noted that after they married, Phoebe quit working for her father. As a result, Myra stopped seeing Lewis and eventually cut him off from her life. Afterward, she noted that she found peace and calmness living without Lewis in her life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/36397820f5bb9c44dbd4791c4ab526d1.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Jerry Lee Lewis with his wife at the airport as they prepare to leave the United Kingdom after the cancellation of his tour in the wake of the uproar caused by the revelation of his marriage to his 13-year-old cousin, London, May 27, 1958. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>The following year, Myra released her memoir "The Spark That Survived," detailing her difficult experiences during her marriage to Lewis and how she handled everything. Speaking about the challenges detailed in her book, Myra <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2022-10-28/jerry-lee-lewis-myra-gale-brown-third-wife-book>noted</a> (via LA Times):</p><p class=dh>"I not only survived it.
