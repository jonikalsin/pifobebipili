NOVIAS from Blake Shelton’s team was one of them. The country singer went with a song of his genre for Chris Stapleton’s “Cold” and for his last song, he went with Lenny Kravitz’s “Fly Away”.</p><p>In 2023, other than making a comeback in music with a feature on NBC’s The Voice has continued to have a joyful life with his partner <a href=#>Elissa Henry</a>, while also often seeing his parents.
