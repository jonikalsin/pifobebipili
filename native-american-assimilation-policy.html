He promulgated a six-step system for assimilation, which included impartial justice towards the Native Americans, regulation of their land, promotion of commerce and punishment for those who violated their rights.

This act did not force them to leave, but it did give the president the right to negotiate land exchange treaties with tribes in the United States.</p><p>One of the worst deals was the Treaty of Echota, signed by only a handful of Cherokees, but not any tribal elders, that ceded Cherokee native lands to the government. Georgia would later take action against the tribe for failure to follow through with the treaty and forcibly remove them from their land, leading to the Trail of Tears.</p><p>The Cherokee, along with other tribes like the Seminoles, Chickasaws, Choctaws, and Muscogees, were relocated to unfamiliar and infertile territory with little knowledge of how to survive.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-36810 alt="US Indian Assimilation Policy Chief" width=600 height=411 data-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/US-indian-assimilation-chief.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-36810 class=wp-caption-text>Source:</p><p>When Ulysses S.

The Lakota Sioux and Northern Cheyenne led a series of attacks against the United States as settlers encroached on the gold-rich Black Hills, which were protected Indian land, and which the Lakota consider to be sacred. The U.S. government tried to convince the Lakota to relocate so miners could use the area, but they refused.</p><p>One of the most memorable battles of the Great Sioux War was the defeat of the 7th U.S. Cavalry at the Battle of Little Bighorn, also known as Custer’s Last Stand. This battle occurred June 25 – 26, 1876, in Montana territory.

The code was an outright attack on Native American identity, outlawing participation in traditional dances, funeral practices, use of medicine men and polygamy.

To honor his vision, the Ghost Dance was performed, but settlers were worried and assumed that they were preparing for an attack.

The police fired shots, killing Sitting Bull and eight of his supporters. Six policemen also died. This led to the Wounded Knee Massacre in which the 7th U.S. Cavalry killed 150 Lakota men, women and children.

The Nevada Test Site was constructed on Shoshone lands and was the site of nuclear testing from 1951 to 1991. Furthermore, tribes often own land communally, so businesses have a difficult time operating on native lands, as there is disagreement about U.S. government or tribal law purvue.</p><p>All of these issues contribute to cultural distress, which exacerbates poverty. It is only through serious research, unified commitment, and dedicated economic planning that the government and Native Americans will begin to solve some of these problems and build peace across a culturally territorial divide.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyvrdOirZ5lkaKys7XCmqVmmaOotq61y5qroqeeYr2wuMicsA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./amber-luke.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Amber Luke">&larr;
